## About the game

Quoridor is an abstract strategy game where players compete to be the first to navigate their pawn from one side of the board to the opposite side. The catch? Players can strategically place walls to impede their opponents' progress, adding a layer of tactical complexity. Players take turns moving their pawn or placing walls, aiming to outmaneuver their opponents and reach the goal.
